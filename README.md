#FOLLOWING IS THE ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
#    (a) Read in 20 integer values from the terminal and place them in an array. Note the code to perform
#this step is already provided.
#    (b) In the main function, create a second array of ﬂoat values. The odd values should be calculated by computing the sine function1 on the integer passed in to the same index, and the even values should be computed by taking the cosine of the indexed value.
#    (c) Print out the values of the each array on their line using the showFloats and showIntegers func-tions.
#    (d) For each integer, print out the number of ’1’ bits in the resulting representation by calling the function countBits.
#      (You should use the man utility on the sin() and cos() functions to ﬁnd out the syntax of this function.)
#    (e) Sort the arrays using the integerQuickSort and floatQuickSort functions respectively.
#    (f) Print the median value of each array using the medianFloat and medianInteger functions, respec-tively.
#    (g) Cast each integer to an unsigned short type and compute a number with bits reversed by calling the reverseBits function. Print out a binary representation of the each of the numbers by calling the binaryString on two string arrays and printing out the resulting text.
#    (h) Print out the sorted arrays again using the showInts and showFloats functions.
#    (i) Print out the CDF plot of the integer array values, where the X axis shows the range of values, from low to high stepping by one, and the Y axis goes from 100% down to 0%, stepping by 5. Note that a CDF is the cumulative distribution function graph that shows the percentage of values in the array that or equal to the value or lower.
